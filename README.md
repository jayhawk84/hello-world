# hello-world
Well, it turns out I'm not a student anymore, so that means I should update this file.  And now looking in on it, I realize I only ever did the first step on this github tutorial by making the repository and readme.  I did nothing further.  I wonder how many other people took over a year to make the first branch of their first github repository??  I've got to be in a special class!  

So.... I have deleted the first sentence which said I was inexperienced and insecure student coder.  I think some of it still applies, but nevertheless I am more experienced and school is in the past.  Onward ho!
